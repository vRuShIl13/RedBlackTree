# RedBlackTree
Full implementation of Red Black Trees from scratch

Java implementation of how the Red Black Tree data structure works.
The project will take in a csv file and carry out all the commands found in that file.

The data structure has the following functions:

1.  Insert has parameters key and value (forming a key-value pair) and no
    output. O(log n) running time.
    
2.  Search has parameter key and should output the value associated with
    that key in the dictionary. O(log n) running time.
    
3.  Delete has parameter key and no output O(log n) running time.
4.  
5.  Minimum has no parameters and should output the key and value of the
    key-value pair with the smallest key. O(1) running time.
    
5.  Maximum has no parameters and should output the key and value of the
    key-value pair with the largest key. O(1) running time.
    
6.  Select has parameter i and should output the key and value of the key-value pair of rank i.
    O(log n) running time.
    
7.  Rank has parameter key and should output the rank of the key-value pair
    with this key. O(log n) running time.
